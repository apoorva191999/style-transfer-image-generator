# AI Style Transfer with Image Generation 

This project combines a base image with AI-generated styles using an API, giving you **three style options** to choose from before producing the final image.

##  Features
- Upload your own base image (or use a URL).
- Enter a style prompt for the AI.
- View the top 3 generated style images.
- Choose your favorite and get the final processed image.
- Try as many prompts as you like.

## How It Works
1. You give the program a base image link or file path.
2. Enter a prompt describing the style you want.
3. The API generates **3 possible styles**.
4. Pick your favorite or try another prompt.
5. The script applies your chosen style to the base image.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/style-transfer-image-generator.git
cd style-transfer-image-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
